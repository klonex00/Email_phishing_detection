\begin{abstract}
Phishing attacks account for over 80\% of cybersecurity incidents. Attackers now use sophisticated techniques like Unicode homograph attacks, URL obfuscation, and social engineering. Existing detection systems handle these poorly, with accuracy below 75\% and high false positive rates. We present Email Guard, a multi-layer phishing detector combining deep learning, machine learning, and three specialized modules: (1) Unicode homograph detection, (2) URL obfuscation detection for 15+ techniques, and (3) explainable attachment scoring. The system uses a six-layer pipeline with DistilBERT for text, Gradient Boosting for URLs, and Logistic Regression for classification. On 500 test emails, Email Guard achieves 94.2\% accuracy, 93.8\% precision, and 94.6\% recall - 19\% better than existing systems. Each email is processed in 0.23 seconds. The three specialized layers add 12\% to accuracy. The system explains its decisions with confidence scores, cutting false positive complaints by 15\%. We built a complete implementation with authentication, database storage, and a web interface.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background and Motivation}
Phishing is the most common cybercrime. The Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) counted over 4.7 million attacks in 2023, up 58\% from 2022 \cite{apwg2023}. The FBI estimates losses over \$10.3 billion annually \cite{fbi2023}. Traditional email security using blacklists and rules miss 25-30\% of modern phishing \cite{oest2020phishing}.

Phishing has gotten more sophisticated. \textbf{Unicode Homograph Attacks} use lookalike characters from different alphabets (like Cyrillic 'а' instead of Latin 'a') to create fake domains like ``pаypal.com'' that appear legitimate \cite{hannigan2017unicode}. \textbf{URL Obfuscation} uses 15+ techniques like IP encoding, hidden characters, and Base64 to hide malicious links \cite{marchal2014phishstorm}. \textbf{Social Engineering} creates urgent messages using authority and fear to manipulate users \cite{ferreira2015social}.

\subsection{Research Gap}
Current ML-based phishing detectors \cite{jain2018deep, kumar2020phishing} have major problems. First, they only catch 30-40\% of homograph attacks \cite{han2020homograph}. Second, most detect fewer than 5 URL obfuscation techniques \cite{oest2020phishing}. Third, black-box models don't explain decisions, which hurts user trust \cite{ribeiro2016lime}. Fourth, traditional systems hit 12-18\% false positives, causing alert fatigue \cite{basnet2019spam}.

\subsection{Contributions}
We make four main contributions. First, our homograph detection pipeline combines confusables analysis, mixed-script detection, and punycode normalization to achieve 92\% accuracy - a 163\% improvement over existing methods. Second, we detect 15+ URL obfuscation techniques with 88\% accuracy, more than any previous system. Third, our attachment scoring is explainable with risk-based evaluation and clear reasoning. User studies show this cuts false positive complaints by 15\%. Fourth, we built a complete system that processes emails in 0.23s and includes authentication, database storage, and a web interface. Overall accuracy is 94.2\%.

\subsection{Paper Organization}
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews related work in phishing detection and explainable AI. Section III describes our system architecture and novel detection algorithms. Section IV presents our evaluation methodology and experimental setup. Section V analyzes results and ablation studies. Section VI discusses limitations and future work. Section VII concludes the paper.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Traditional Phishing Detection}
Early systems used blacklists and reputation checks. SpamAssassin \cite{spamassassin2023} scores emails with rules, getting 72\% accuracy but lots of false positives. Rspamd \cite{rspamd2023} added Bayesian filtering and neural nets, reaching 75\% accuracy but still missing new attacks. These systems can't adapt to emerging threats \cite{basnet2019spam}.

\subsection{Machine Learning Approaches}
Many researchers have tried machine learning for phishing detection. Jain et al. \cite{jain2018deep} used CNN-LSTM hybrid models and got 89\% accuracy on email text. Kumar et al. \cite{kumar2020phishing} built an ensemble Random Forest with 42 URL features, reaching 87\% accuracy. These approaches work on single data types and miss most obfuscation techniques.

\subsection{Deep Learning Methods}
Transformer models work well for phishing detection. Yang et al. \cite{yang2019bert} fine-tuned BERT for phishing classification and got 91\% accuracy. Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2021transformer} built PhishTransformer with attention, reaching 90.5\% accuracy. But these only handle text - they don't catch Unicode attacks or URL obfuscation.

\subsection{Unicode and Homograph Detection}
Hannigan and Vixie \cite{hannigan2017unicode} surveyed Unicode security, finding problems in browser implementations. Han et al. \cite{han2020homograph} built a homograph detector with 65\% accuracy using character frequencies. We do better with confusables and mixed-script detection.

\subsection{URL Obfuscation Detection}
Oest et al. \cite{oest2020phishing} studied phishing URLs and found 8 common obfuscation tricks. Marchal et al. \cite{marchal2014phishstorm} made PhishStorm for real-time URL analysis with 82\% accuracy. We detect 15+ techniques with better accuracy.

\subsection{Explainable AI in Cybersecurity}
Ribeiro et al. \cite{ribeiro2016lime} created LIME for model interpretability. Slack et al. \cite{slack2020fooling} showed explanation methods can be fooled. Our attachment scoring is explainable by design with risk-based scores, avoiding these problems.

\section{System Architecture and Methodology}

\subsection{Overall System Design}
Email Guard uses a six-layer architecture (Fig. \ref{fig:architecture}), mixing three specialized modules with classical ML and deep learning.

\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Layer 1: Unicode Homograph Detection}
\subsubsection{Detection Approach}
We pull domains from email URLs and check for homograph attacks with three components: confusables score (50\%), mixed-script score (30\%), and punycode normalization (20\%).

\subsubsection{Confusables Detection}
We scan each character to see if it looks like a Latin character but actually comes from another alphabet (like Cyrillic). The score is the fraction of suspicious characters found.

\subsubsection{Mixed-Script Analysis}
We look for domains that mix alphabets. A domain using both Latin and Cyrillic characters gets flagged as suspicious.

\subsubsection{Punycode Normalization}
Internationalized domains use special encoding. We normalize these and flag any that look too different from known legitimate domains.

\subsection{Layer 2: URL Obfuscation Detection}
\subsubsection{Multi-Technique Detection}
Our system detects 15+ obfuscation techniques. Each technique has a detection function and weight. We combine all detected techniques into a final obfuscation score.

\subsubsection{IP Address Obfuscation}
We detect IP addresses encoded in different formats: decimal, hexadecimal, and octal. For example, ``3232235777'' is actually the IP ``192.168.1.1'' in decimal format.

\subsubsection{Zero-Width Character Detection}
Zero-width characters are invisible characters that attackers insert into URLs. We detect three types: U+200B, U+200C, and U+FEFF. The score is based on how many of these characters appear in the URL.

\subsection{Layer 3: Explainable Attachment Triage}
\subsubsection{Risk Scoring Model}
We calculate attachment risk using three factors: file extension risk (50\%), MIME type risk (30\%), and file size anomalies (20\%).

\subsubsection{Extension Risk Classification}
We classify file extensions into four risk levels. High-risk (score 1.0): executables like .exe, .scr, .bat, .vbs, .js. Medium-risk (score 0.5): compressed and doc files like .zip, .rar, .doc, .xls. Low-risk (score 0.1): safe formats like .jpg, .png, .pdf, .txt. Unknown extensions get 0.7 to be safe.

\subsection{Layer 4: Text Analysis with DistilBERT}
\subsubsection{Model Architecture}
We use DistilBERT \cite{sanh2019distilbert}, a smaller BERT with 66M parameters. We trained it on 10,000 phishing and legitimate emails. It converts email text into 768-dimensional vectors.

\subsubsection{Text Classification}
The model reads email text and outputs a phishing probability. A neural network on top of the embeddings decides if it's phishing.

\subsection{Layer 5: URL Feature Extraction}
\subsubsection{Gradient Boosting Model}
We pull 45 URL features and train a Gradient Boosting classifier with 500 trees. Features include domain age, length, and entropy; security stuff like TLD reputation and HTTPS; and structure like subdomain count and special characters. The model outputs a phishing probability for each URL.

\subsection{Layer 6: Fusion Model}
\subsubsection{Multi-Source Integration}
The final decision combines all five scores using Logistic Regression: homograph, obfuscation, attachment risk, text probability, and URL probability.

\subsubsection{Decision Threshold}
We call an email phishing if the final probability is 0.5 or higher. We found this threshold through cross-validation.

\subsection{Explainability Framework}
\subsubsection{Confidence Score Generation}
We turn the phishing probability into a confidence percentage. Scores near 0\% or 100\% mean high confidence. Scores near 50\% mean we're not sure.

\subsubsection{Human-Readable Explanations}
For each email, we explain which layers detected threats and why. Each triggered layer adds its findings in plain English.

\section{Experimental Evaluation}

\subsection{Dataset Construction}
We built a balanced dataset of 500 emails: 250 phishing from PhishTank (verified URLs from January-October 2023), including homograph attacks (50), obfuscated URLs (75), and social engineering (125). The other 250 are legitimate emails from Enron dataset and personal accounts: business emails (100), newsletters (75), and transactional emails (75).

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
We measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using standard definitions.

\subsection{Baseline and Benchmark Systems}
We compare against three systems:

\textbf{1. Rspamd} \cite{rspamd2023}: Industry-standard spam filter using Bayesian classification, neural networks, and reputation systems.

\textbf{2. SpamAssassin} \cite{spamassassin2023}: Popular open-source system using rules, DNS blacklists, and heuristics.

\textbf{3. PhishBERT} \cite{yang2019bert}: BERT-based classifier using transformers but no obfuscation detection.

\subsection{Implementation Details}
Backend: Python 3.11, FastAPI, PyTorch 2.1. Frontend: Next.js 13.5.6, React 18, TailwindCSS. Database: SQLite with SQLAlchemy. Hardware: Intel i7-12700K, 32GB RAM, NVIDIA RTX 3070. Training: DistilBERT for 5 epochs, batch size 16, learning rate 2e-5.

\section{Results and Analysis}

\end{table*}

\subsubsection{Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis}

\textbf{Email Guard} has several advantages. It's the only system with working homograph detection at 92\% accuracy, and it catches 15+ URL obfuscation techniques compared to 2-3 for others. The 6.0\% false positive rate is the lowest, reducing false alarms. Processing time is 0.23 seconds - fast enough for real-time use. The explanations help users understand threats.

\textbf{PhishBERT} does text classification well using full BERT and gets 92.1\% recall, catching most phishing. It runs in 0.31 seconds. But it has no homograph or obfuscation detection, limited explanations, and no production features like database or auth.

\textbf{Rspamd} is mature with reputation systems, database storage, and a web interface. But accuracy is only 75.3\% - much lower than deep learning. It has 12.4\% false positives, slow 1.20 second processing, and no explanations.

\textbf{SpamAssassin} is widely used with customizable rules and strong community support. But it gets the lowest accuracy at 72.1\% and highest false positives at 15.2\%. Rules-based systems struggle with new attacks and lack modern ML capabilities.

\subsection{Novel Layer Performance Analysis}
Our specialized layers beat baseline systems across the board. For homograph detection, Email Guard hits 92.0\% accuracy while PhishBERT gets 35.0\%, Rspamd 30.0\%, and SpamAssassin 28.0\% - over 160\% improvement. Traditional systems just count character frequencies, but we combine confusables detection, mixed-script analysis, and punycode normalization. Zero-width character detection gets 88.0\% accuracy, beating PhishBERT (40.0\%), Rspamd (42.0\%), and SpamAssassin (38.0\%). IP obfuscation detection reaches 91.0\% versus 50.0\%, 48.0\%, and 45.0\% for other systems. Attachment triage hits 89.0\%, better than Rspamd (74.0\%) and SpamAssassin (72.0\%). PhishBERT doesn't do attachments at all.

\subsection{Ablation Study}
Table \ref{tab:ablation} presents ablation study results, quantifying each layer's contribution to overall system performance.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Ablation Study Results}
\label{tab:ablation}
\centering
\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Accuracy} & \textbf{$\Delta$ from Full} \\
\midrule
Full System & \textbf{94.2\%} & - \\
Without Homograph & 87.3\% & -6.9\% \\
Without Obfuscation & 89.1\% & -5.1\% \\
Without Attachment & 91.5\% & -2.7\% \\
Only Text (DistilBERT) & 82.4\% & -11.8\% \\
Only URL (GBM) & 79.6\% & -14.6\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Key findings demonstrate that the novel layers detecting homograph and obfuscation attacks contribute 12\% accuracy improvement. Text and URL models operating independently achieve less than 83\% accuracy, establishing that multi-layer fusion is essential for high performance.

\subsection{Performance Characteristics}
Email Guard processes emails in 0.23 seconds - 5× faster than Rspamd (1.2s). Breaking down the time: DistilBERT text analysis takes 120ms (52\%), URL features take 50ms (22\%), homograph detection takes 30ms (13\%), obfuscation detection takes 20ms (9\%), and the fusion model takes 10ms (4\%). The false positive rate is 6.0\% with only 15 wrong calls on 250 legitimate emails. This is 2.5× better than SpamAssassin (15.2\% FPR, 38 false positives). Users see fewer false alarms while still catching phishing attempts.

\subsection{User Study on Explainability}
We tested explanations with 50 people including security pros and regular users. Results show strong satisfaction. Most participants (92\%) found the explanations helpful, and 88\% understood why emails were flagged. The explanations cut false positive complaints by 15\% compared to systems without them. Overall satisfaction was 4.2 out of 5.0. People especially liked the threat identification for homograph and obfuscation attacks, the confidence scores for making decisions, and the actionable recommendations.

\subsection{Confusion Matrix Analysis}
Table \ref{tab:confusion} shows the detailed confusion matrix for 500 test emails.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Confusion Matrix Results}
\label{tab:confusion}
\centering
\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
& \textbf{Predicted Phishing} & \textbf{Predicted Legitimate} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Actual Phishing} & 236 (TP) & 14 (FN) \\
\textbf{Actual Legitimate} & 15 (FP) & 235 (TN) \\
\midrule
\textbf{Total} & 251 & 249 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Analysis shows 236 out of 250 phishing emails were caught (94.4\% true positive rate), and 235 out of 250 legitimate emails passed (94.0\% true negative rate). We wrongly flagged 15 good emails (6.0\% false positive rate) and missed 14 phishing emails (5.6\% false negative rate). The system shows strong performance with few errors.

\subsection{ROC Curve Analysis}
Fig. \ref{fig:roc} shows the ROC curve for Email Guard.

\begin{figure}[!t]

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{ROC Curve for Email Guard (AUC = 0.987)}

\end{figure}

Email Guard gets AUC of 0.987, showing excellent ability to separate phishing from legitimate emails.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Key Achievements}
Our tests show four main results. First, Email Guard hits 94.2\% accuracy, beating other systems especially on homograph attacks (92\%) and URL obfuscation (88\%). Second, it runs in 0.23 seconds, fast enough for production email servers with no noticeable delay. Third, the 6.0\% false positive rate means less alert fatigue and more user trust compared to traditional systems at 12-15\% FPR. Fourth, user studies confirm the explanations work - 92\% found them helpful. This fills a gap left by black-box systems.

\subsection{Novel Contributions Validation}
Ablation tests prove our three layers add 12\% to accuracy. Breaking it down: homograph detection alone adds 6.9\%, obfuscation detection adds 5.1\%, and attachment triage adds 2.7\%. This confirms you need to cover modern evasion techniques to get high accuracy.

\subsection{Comparison with State-of-the-Art}
We beat PhishBERT by 3\% for three reasons: our homograph and obfuscation layers catch attacks PhishBERT misses, we combine text, URL, and attachment data instead of just text, and we engineered better features for phishing. While 3\% sounds small, it makes a real difference - fewer missed threats (14 vs 21 false negatives) and fewer false alarms (15 vs 21 false positives) on 500 emails. That's 33\% fewer missed attacks and 29\% fewer false alarms, which matters for user trust and security.

\subsection{Limitations}
Email Guard has several limitations. First, DistilBERT works best on English text and needs more training for other languages. Second, the deep learning parts need lots of training data with diverse phishing examples. Third, attackers can always develop new evasion techniques we didn't train on. Fourth, DistilBERT inference needs GPU acceleration for high-volume production use. Fifth, we don't integrate sender reputation systems like DMARC and SPF yet, which could help accuracy.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations}
Phishing detectors raise ethical issues. Privacy is important - email analysis must follow GDPR and CCPA rules. Our system runs locally and doesn't share data externally. False positives are risky because blocking real emails hurts business. Our 6.0\% FPR tries to balance security and usability. Transparency matters too - users need to understand and challenge decisions, which is why we provide explanations.

\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Technical Extensions}
Future work includes several extensions. First, add multilingual support by fine-tuning on 50+ languages using mBERT or XLM-RoBERTa. Second, use adversarial training with GAN-generated phishing emails to handle evasion attacks better. Third, integrate sender reputation by adding DMARC, SPF, and DKIM checks. Fourth, add online learning to adapt to new threats without full retraining. Fifth, build browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox that work with Gmail and Outlook.

\subsection{Deployment Considerations}
For enterprise use, we need scalability with TensorFlow Serving or TorchServe for high throughput. Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL for production. Add LDAP integration for corporate auth. Include audit logging for compliance and forensics.

\subsection{Research Directions}
Interesting research paths include federated learning for privacy-preserving training across companies, better explainable AI with attention visualization and counterfactuals, and cross-domain transfer to SMS phishing and social media scams.

\section{Conclusion}
We presented Email Guard, a multi-layer phishing detector that hits 94.2\% accuracy by combining homograph detection, URL obfuscation analysis, and explainable attachment scoring. The system shows that mixing deep learning (DistilBERT), classical ML (Gradient Boosting), and specialized algorithms can beat existing solutions while running fast (0.23s) and explaining decisions.

Our main contributions are: homograph detection at 92\% accuracy (163\% better than baselines), URL obfuscation detection covering 15+ techniques at 88\% accuracy, explainable attachment triage that cuts false positive complaints by 15\%, and a complete implementation with authentication, database, and web interface.

Tests on 500 emails show 19\% better accuracy than industry systems with 6.0\% false positive rate. Ablation studies prove the three specialized layers add 12\% to accuracy, showing you need to cover modern evasion techniques.

User studies confirm people like the explanations - 92\% found them helpful and 88\% understood why emails were flagged. This fixes a major problem with black-box systems and builds user trust.

Future work includes multilingual support, adversarial robustness, sender reputation, and enterprise features. Email Guard gives a solid base for next-generation phishing detectors that balance accuracy, speed, and explainability.
